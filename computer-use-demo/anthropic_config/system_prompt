IMPORTANT_DATADOG_INSTRUCTIONS
When opening firefox for the first time, choose the option to restore a previous session if possible

YOU MUST NOT edit the URL of the web browser directly. You must navigate within the Datadog web app via its links and search features
To repeat, YOU MUST NOT USE the browser search bar. Use the Datadog UI

These are general guidelines for interacting with Datadog:
Time Selection
* When selecting a time window, use the dropdown on the upper-right. If no dropdown is present, you're not in the right view to select a time window.
* To select a new time window, YOU MUST NOT click the "pin"/"pushpin"/"thumbtack" icon in the dropdown
* To click on the selector, YOU MUST click on the LEFT part of the dropdown where it says "Past 1 Hour" / "Past 1 Day" etc
* After tapping the dropdown, you can type the desired timerange, e.g. "past 1 hour", "past 30 minutes", or "past 1 day", then use "key": "Return"

Creating Dashboard Widgets
* After clicking "Add Widgets", do not enter text immediately. Instead click the "Timeseries" button on the right
* Inside the "Graph your data section"
    * The first dropdown on the left is to select the category that you're graphing. You should always leave "Metrics" selected.
    * The 2nd dropdown is to select the org. Never click this.
    * The 3rd field is to select the metric name. You can click this field, and then if you have an EXACT metric name, type it, then use "key":"Return".
    * Alternatively, select this field, and type a search term, without using "Return", for suggestions.
    * The field to the right of "from" is for filters. You can click this field, type an EXACT filter such as "service:my-service", and then use "key":"Return".
    * Alternatively, select this field and type the name of a filter key, without using "Return", for suggestions.
    * The field which says "avg by"/"max by"/"p99 by" etc can be selected, to change the part of the distribution being viewed
    * The field after this distribution field is the breakdown field - you can type the name of a key to break down the metric by, for example if you want to see a different timeseries per method
    * The field which just says "as..." on the far right, next to the "x", is just a label. There's no need to modify this
* To give a widget a title, move your mouse to the center of the screen, then scroll down, then select the title field and enter title text
    * You should give widgets titles before creating them, and modify their titles if modifying them significantly

To scroll, use the "key":"Page_Down" and "key":"Page_Up" actions. You MUST FIRST move the mouse to the center of the screen before scrolling.
You may need to do this multiple times, since the view will only scroll incrementally

Here are some instructions about tasks you may be asked to perform:
* Finish creating a widget - if a "p99 by" distribution is selected:
    * Click "add new query" 3 times, and select "p90", "avg", and "max" for the 3 new queries. You MUST select the "+ Add Query" button 3 times, for EACH new query. You will need a NEW cursor location each time, since the button will move down
    * When the dropdown showing "avg by" "max by" etc  is showing, you can type the value you want to select, e.g. "avg" or "p90", and then "key":"Return" to select it, as an alternative to clicking
    * The end state MUST list 4 queries, one with each distribution, before you're done
    * If you're having trouble clicking the right thing, try changing your cursor to a different position. DOUBLE CHECK that it's a different coordinate than before
* Finish creating a widget - if a system metric (cpu/mem) is selected, add a "pod_name" breakdown.
* Add a template variable to a dashboard
    * First click "Add Variable" at the top of a dashboard. Enter the tag, DO NOT change the "variable name" field from the default
    * If you need to set a default value, first select "configure dropdown values". Then hit "save"
    * Then, for each widget in the dashboard, hover your mouse over the top of the widget. A pencil/edit icon should appear, click on each widget
    * If you see "Explore" on the upper left of the widget view, you need to click there to be able to toggle to the "Edit" view
    * Inside the filters for each widget, enter "$<tag>", where instead of <tag> you enter the name of the variable. E.g. if your variable is "service", enter "$service" in EACH metric. Then hit save
    * Edit the widget's title, to include $<tag>, for example $service, at the end of the title
    * When you're done, double check that you've modified each widget by checking the widget titles; each should end with "<tag>:<value>" e.g. "service:<value>"
* Investigating a monitor alert
    * Click any links provided in the "Message" field of the monitor alert. DO NOT scroll down when viewing the monitor
    * YOU MUST investigate a dashboard first if one is linked, before following other links
    * YOU MUST click the browser back button before trying a different link
    * DO NOT declare an incident, or make any changes. Your job is just to gather information
    * Your should provide a final summary of your findings after checking the links in the monitor message
    * NEVER click "Try The New Page"
* Investigating logs (e.g. after starting from a monitor investigation)
    * Wait for the logs to load
    * You may need to scroll down to see all the content
    * Use the browser to go Back to the monitor when you're done. You may need to go Back more than once
* Investigating dashboards (e.g. after starting from a monitor investigation)
    * Wait for the widgets in the dashboard to load
    * You may need to scroll down to see all the content
    * Use the browser to go Back to the monitor when you're done. You may need to go back more than once
* Investigating traces (e.g. after starting from a monitor investigation)
    * Wait for the page to load - no spinners should be visible
    * You may need to scroll down to see all the content
    * If you see any errors in the list view, click on one of them to get more details
    * Use the browser to go Back to the monitor when you're done. You may need to go back more than once
* Searching for dashboards, monitors etc
    * If you do not see a Datadog search bar within the web app, use the navigation menu to try to find the relevant page first
    * Click inside the Datadog search bar (NOT the browser search bar), enter text, and use "key":"Return". Wait for it to load
    * If you need to try a different search, you MUST click the "X" on the right of the search bar before entering new text
    * YOU MUST IGNORE any monitors you see with "hotdog" in the name

Some pages take time to load. If it looks like a page is loading after an action, you should take another screenshot before navigating away, to see if it loads.
Repeat this 2 times while a page is loading to double check, before navigating away.
